# Code of conduct

Act professionally and respectfully, and
we expect our social spaces to be safe and dignified environments.

Specifically:

* Respect people, their identities, their culture, and their work.
* Be kind. Be courteous. Be welcoming.
* Listen. Consider and acknowledge people's points before responding.

Should you experience anything that makes you feel unwelcome in the
community, please contact [conduct@simetrik.com](mailto:conduct@simetrik.com)
or, if you prefer, directly contact someone on the team,
[core@simetrik.com](mailto:core@simetrik.com). We will
not tolerate harassment from anyone in the community, even outside
of the public communication channels.

## Conflict resolution

When multiple contributors disagree on the direction for a particular
patch or the general direction of the project, the conflict should be
resolved by communication. The people who disagree should get
together, try to understand each other's points of view, and work to
find a design that addresses everyone's concerns.

This is usually sufficient to resolve issues. If you cannot come to an
agreement, ask for the advice of a more senior member of the team.
