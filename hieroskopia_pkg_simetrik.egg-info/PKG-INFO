Description: # hieroskopia Package
        
        The hiereskopia package its a library to infer properties 
        from dates and numeric data types like formats or separators from samples through regular patterns 
        in a pandas series.
        
        ## Support 
        ###Date-times:
        - Support to dates and datetime format
        - This library receive a series as input and try to return
         a dictionary with the format found in the series Based on the 1989 C 
         Standard date time  format code
        
        ### Numeric:
        - This library receive a series as input and try to return
         a dictionary with the three digit and decimal character separator
        
        ## Usage
        Usage doc based on a similar library called `dateinfer` from `@jeffreystarr`
        
        ````Python
        >>> import hieroskopia
        >>> hierokopia.infer_datetime(['Mon Jan 13 09:52:52 MST 2014', 'Tue Jan 21 15:30:00 EST 2014'])
        >>> {'format': '%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y'}
        ````
        
        The above method works with a best guess approach to detect a format in a series and try 
        to return a `datetime.strftime`/`strptime` format that will cover or parse the majority
        of the samples.
        
        ````Python
        >>> import hieroskopia
        >>> hierokopia.infer_number(['300.231,3', '200,3'])
        >>> {'three_digit_separator': '.', 'decimal_separator': ',' }
        ````
        
        The above method will try to detect and return certain properties in a series
        like `three_digit_separator` or `deciamal_separator` character that will cover 
        the majority of the samples.
        
        
        ## To do:
        - Specify another output standard format to support java date format, snowflake date characters definition etc.
        - Feed more regular expressions
        - Develop multiple algorithms to get a better precision.
